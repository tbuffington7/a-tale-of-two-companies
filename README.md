This repo contains the underlying code I used in my article [_Mean or median? Choose based on the decision, not the distribution_](towardsdatascience.com/mean-or-median-choose-based-on-the-decision-not-the-distribution-f951215c1376). 

The purpose of this code is to show how following the (misguided) conventional wisdom that the median is a more useful summary statistic than the mean can lead a business to a strategic disadvantage. Please refer to the article for more information.
